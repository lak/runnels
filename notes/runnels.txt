Questions:
    - Can we come up with any other useful messages to pass besides logs
      and metrics?

    - How do we handle in-message protocol aspects, like reply needing a class
      name or reply-to needing to be a uuid?

    - How should we handle synchronizing the schema across a bus?  I suppose
      that all nodes should get the schema from the router, which reduces but
      does not eliminate the problem.  At the least, this synchronization implies
      that routers should know about other routers.

    - Should one be able to subscribe to producers more than one hop away?

To start:

    - Create a runnels server that supports these operations:
        - message operations
            - send
            - receive
        - subscription operations
            - subscribe
                - initially, just support class and field subscriptions,
                  with simple booleans and no substrings
            - unsubscribe
            - verify?
        - schema querying
            - there needs to be some kind of standard way for multiple runnel
              servers to all know that they're speaking the same schema

    - Create runnel formats
        - logs
        - metrics

    - Create a runnel client in Puppet
        - logs
        - metrics

    - Create runnel consumers
        - logs, currently just go to flat files
        - metrics, going to rrd files if possible, else just flat files

    - Create a schema checking library
        - Can anything in LDAP be reused?  I do not accept OIDs, but this
          might be a case for RDF
        - Rather than having class versions, can we just have class checksums?
          Versions are somewhat meaningless in a distributed, worldwide network,
          especially with the ability to easily create custom schemas.  Either
          way, we need some way to verify that we have the same definition of
          a class in a distributed way.  Would a centralized schema make sense?
          Hmm.  Per-bus?  At the least, it seems that a whole bus _must_ agree
          on its schema, so it seems silly to not provide for that facility.

    - Create a schema format and parser
        - we could just copy ldap here, but, well, that seems lamish
        - yaml should be fine for the schema, shouldn't it?
            - but we still need something to verify things
