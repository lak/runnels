I've been thinking about integrating system tools for a long time and it has
always seemed like there should be some standard way of getting system tools
to talk to each other.  In general, they exchange pretty simplistic
information like logs, metrics, and alerts, and it should not be that hard to
come up with a generic way for tools to exchange and consume this information.

It's been a plan of mine to support the integration of [Puppet][] with tools like
[RT][], [Nagios][], and any other system management tool.  My attendance at the
[Web 2.0 Conference][] got me thinking about using [Microformats][] to encode the
information but I'd have computers talking directly to each other with no
browsers in the middle.

In the course of thinking about this, spike on #puppet on irc.freenode.net
brought up integration between Puppet and [Trac][].  I've posted a [log][] of that
conversation, but the summary of it is that we need a [message bus][] for
integrating the different system administration tools.  [Ian][] seems to have
said it first: "a programmatic message bus is one of the big missing pieces in
system administration".  Already there was discussion of SMTP, Jabber,
Microformats, XML-RPC, event routers, and most of the other things that we've
decided are now a part of Runnels.

A few days later, I decided to see if I could spur some discussion on the
[SAGE Config Mgmt List][] on this topic, and I seem to have [succeeded][].  The
main conclusions from the conversation were that this would be great to have,
it could not use SMTP, and maybe something like Jabber's protocol would work
well.

That discussion wore down after a few hours, and we took it back to IRC,
where we [came up with the name][] "Runnels".

A day or so later, it came up on IRC [again][], and we were able to pretty well
characterize the problem, including coming up with a list of [definitions][].

We discussed much else, but we only really agreed that our message format is a
plain text collection of name/value pairs, the definitions already linked to,
and the fact that we want to use subscriptions to get messages rather than
having messages record a destination.

We later had a discussion on [semantic tagging][].
