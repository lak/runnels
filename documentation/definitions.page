Definitions of the different elements of a Runnels bus.

* **event**

    something that causes the generation of a message

* **message**

    formatted and parsable information carrying "packet"

* **acceptor**

    something that notes the occurence of an event and generates a suitable
    message

* **convertor**

    stuff that takes input from the acceptor and converts it to the required
    format

* **router**

    stuff that actually sends "packets" elsewhere

* **consumer**

    stuff that accepts messages from a router as a final destination and
    processes them

* **processor**

    something that converts messages into action

* **action**

    whatever results from the receipt of a message, including null

At a minimum, any runnel bus must have a producer and a router, and for
anything to happen it must also have a consumer and a processor.  The action
that a processor takes can include converting the message to another format
like an SNMP trap and forwarding it along appropriately.

Here is the flow of information:

    event => acceptor => convertor => router => consumer => processor => action
